# ABFE-L-ABF-OPES
This repository contains all the input files used for the L-ABF-OPES paper: "L-ABF-OPES: Absolute Binding Free Energy Calculations Using Local Adaptively Biased Force and On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling
" (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.17233).

# About

L-ABF-OPES is a computational method designed to calculate absolute binding free energy (ABFE). The inputs provided here were used to evaluate the ABFE of:

* The BRD4 complex with 11 different drug-like molecules
* The Benzimidazole-Trypsin system

# Repository Contents

This repository includes all the neccesary inputs to run L-ABF-OPES uisng Tinker-HP/Colvars:
* Electrostatic (ELE) and van der Waals (VDW) inputs for complex and solvent phases.
* Restraint-free gas phase simulation to calculate the DBC restraint correction
